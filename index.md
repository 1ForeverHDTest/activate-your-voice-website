		<blockquote>“Janet’s been a fantastic coach. I originally reached out a few months back to develop my vocal and reading ability. We started off with articulation, pronunciation and breathing exercises which I now practice on a day to day basis. These collectively have helped develop my vocal resonance and clarity when speaking. As always, I look forward to our next session”. <span>— Ben Horton</span></blockquote>
		<blockquote>“Janet is a very confident voice coach. She has taught me a wide range of vocal exercises and techniques to improve my spoken English and clarity of my voice, as well as the modulation. As a foreign speaker I have found practicing the phonetic sounds invaluable. Janet has improved my confidence and I would highly recommend her”. <span>— Ben Haldon at My Coach School</span></blockquote>
		<blockquote>“We’ve been very pleased with the sessions our son has been having with Janet. We feel as though his confidence has really come on and Janet does a great job keeping him engaged. We weren’t sure about switching to online and although nothing beats face to face, it’s remarkable how it can work well online too”. <span>— Kongrit Khamkhoon</span></blockquote>

		<blockquote>“I started with Janet a few months ago and since not only have I found my voice for speaking and podcasting, but I have found a new sense of confidence in myself day to day. I wish I had plucked up the courage to do this a lot earlier, but the lessons have been literally life changing in refining one of the most valuable instruments we have, the voice. I also delivered one of the best speeches of my life at my wedding thanks to Janet and all her help”. <span>— Christopher Bluff</span></blockquote>
		<blockquote>“Voice coaching with Janet has been a revelation to me! I’ve learned so much in a short space of time and am making steady progress.
